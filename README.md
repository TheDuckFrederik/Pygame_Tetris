I have created this game as a project for our subject Introduction to Programming. M14. Except for the music I have created everything else myself. I would like to say thanks to my amazing teacher XaSaFa for helping us in our journey. Also, I would like to give credit to Î”riK & Karl Casey/White Bat for the music.
The in-game controls are pretty simple, the down/left/right arrow keys are to move and the up arrow to rotate. The "n" key is for starting a new game, the "p" is for pausing the game and the "Esc" is for returning to the menu.
The hard mode variant is just a challenge on its own, changing some things. If you find vanilla Tetris a bit easy/boring, the hard mode will spice things up.
